# Play Cricket MVP

This project is a way for me to test my web scraping skills, and use of Pandas for mathematical functions.

Idea 
-----------
User inputs a Play Cricket ID (i.e. for a link `https://newlongton.play-cricket.com/website/results/4598109`, the ID is 4598109.
Outputs are:
- whole match MVP: most-valuable player of the match based on how much better they performed to other players across all disciplines
- batter MVP: the best performing batter, based on comparisons against other players
- bowling MVP: the best performing bowler, based on comparisons against other players
- home team/away team MVP: the best players from each side.
