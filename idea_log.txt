Ideas to implement ---


// For the MVP Function //
1/ Fielding points
2/ Add functionality for dealing with balls faced, boundaries etc. when they are added
3/ Similarly, with partnerships. If a player was in a 100 run partnership but only scored
   10, they had a valuable input to the team (esp. tailenders)
4/ Don't have arbitrary values. Create real valuability scores using past games

// Other //
1/ Web app using Django
