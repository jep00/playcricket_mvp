#Â Finding the average score for each batting position group
# and for bowlers

'''
A note:
For bowling, we would ideally compare against another form of check. 'Bowling position' isn't a thing, and
play-cricket has no way of letting us know if a bowler is left- or right-armed, a spinner, seamer, medium pacer,
fast bowler, etc.
